[note1:] The idea started as a private filter in Path of Diablo, several years ago and the co-creator is NODRULE.
[note2:] This product is original, but the structure was inspired by KRYSZARD and some other aspects by RETROCRO.
[note3:] This filter is teaching you which items are the best, only those get notification.
