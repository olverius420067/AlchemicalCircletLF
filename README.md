# The idea started as a private filter in Path of Diablo, several years ago and the co-creator is NODRULE.
# The goal of the filter is to be easy to use by everyone. but mostly for the 99 pushers.
# It's useless to see white and blue items, because you can craft on yellow items, also all socketed items get only the sockets that you need to use.
# This filter is teaching you which items are the best, only those get notification.
